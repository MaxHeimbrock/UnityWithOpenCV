# UnityWithOpenCV
Unity Project accessing the webcam, sending each frame to an OpenCV plugin .dll and displaying the result

in Assets/Plugins the meta files are still there, but the original OpenCV dlls have to be copied there again, since they are to big for GitHub. Also the custom processing dll has to be copied to the folder.
